                    steps to the podium. Sampson's
                    research has focused on the
                    ecology and evolution of late
                    Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has
                    conducted fieldwork in a number of
                    countries in Africa.</p>
                <p>Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist 1,vho received his Ph.D.
                    in zoology from the University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on
                    two new species of ceratopsids (horned dinosaurs) from the Late
                    Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the gro\Nth and function of certopsid
                    horns and frills.</p>
